\subsection{}

Let~$\cat{C}$ be a locally small category and let~$\cat{D}$ be a category equivalent to~$\cat{C}$.
This means that there exists an equivalence of categories~$F$ from~$\cat{D}$ to~$\cat{C}$.
The functor~$F$ is both full and faithful by Theorem~1.5.9, and therefore induces for every two objects~$d$ and~$d'$ of~$\cat{D}$ the bijection
\[
	\cat{D}(d, d') \xto{F} \cat{C}(F d, F d') \,.
\]
We know that~$\cat{C}(F d, F d')$ is a set because the category~$\cat{C}$ is locally small.
Consequently,~$\cat{D}(d, d')$ is also a set.
