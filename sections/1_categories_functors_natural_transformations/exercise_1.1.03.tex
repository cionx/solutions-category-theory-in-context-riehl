We denote the object of~$c / \cat{C}$ as pairs~$(f, x)$, where~$x$ is an object of~$\cat{C}$ and~$f$ is a morphism from~$c$ to~$x$ in~$\cat{C}$.

We first need to explain how the composition of morphisms in~$c / \cat{C}$ is supposed to work.
Given two such morphisms
\[
	φ \colon (f, x) \to (g, y)
	\quad\text{and}\quad
	ψ \colon (g, y) \to (h, z)
\]
in~$c / \cat{C}$, we have the following commutative diagram:
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		{}
		&
		c
		\arrow{dl}[above left]{f}
		\arrow{d}[right]{g}
		\arrow{dr}[above right]{h}
		&
		{}
		\\
		x
		\arrow{r}[above]{φ}
		&
		y
		\arrow{r}[above]{ψ}
		&
		z
	\end{tikzcd}
\]
By leaving the node~$y$ out of this diagram, we arrive at the following commutative diagram:
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		{}
		&
		c
		\arrow{dl}[above left]{f}
		\arrow{dr}[above right]{h}
		&
		{}
		\\
		x
		\arrow{rr}[above]{ψ φ}
		&
		{}
		&
		z
	\end{tikzcd}
\]
The commutativity of this diagram tells us that the composite~$ψ φ$ (taken in~$\cat{C}$) is a morphism from~$(f, x)$ to~$(h, z)$ in~$c / \cat{C}$.
This observation allows us to define the composite of~$φ$ and~$ψ$ in~$c / \cat{C}$ as their composite in~$\cat{C}$.

The associativity of composition of morphisms in~$c / \cat{C}$ follows from the associativity of composition of morphisms in~$\cat{C}$.

We have for every object~$(f, x)$ in~$c / \cat{C}$ the following commutative diagram:
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		{}
		&
		c
		\arrow{dl}[above left]{f}
		\arrow{dr}[above right]{f}
		&
		{}
		\\
		x
		\arrow{rr}[above]{\id_x}
		&
		{}
		&
		x
	\end{tikzcd}
\]
The commutativity of this diagram tells us that~$\id_x$ is a morphism from~$(f, x)$ to~$(f, x)$ in~$c / \cat{C}$.
We have for every morphism~$φ \colon (f, x) \to (g, y)$ in~$c / \cat{C}$ the equalities
\[
	φ 1_x = φ \,,
	\quad\text{and}\quad
	1_y φ = φ
\]
in~$\cat{C}$, and therefore also in~$c / \cat{C}$.

We have thus shown that the identity morphism of~$x$ in~$\cat{C}$ serves as the identity morphism of~$(f, x)$ in~$c / \cat{C}$.%
\footnote{
	We should actually ensure that~\spaces{$\Hom$} in~$c / \cat{C}$ are pairwise disjoint, but we don’t care about this for now -- we could just apply the usual construction of replacing every morphism~$φ \colon (f, x) \to (g, y)$ by its triple~$(φ, (f, x), (g, y))$ to ensure this technical requirement.

\subsubsection{}

This part of the exercise works completely dual to the first part:
just reverse all the arrows.
(That is,~$\cat{C} / c ≅ (c / \cat{C}^{\op})^{\op}$.)
