\subsection{}

For the first part of this exercise we can adapt our argumentation from the previous exercise to the specific example
\[
	\cat{C} = \Set \,,
	\quad
	x = \{ 1, 2 \} \,,
	\quad
	y = \{ \ast \} \,,
	\quad
	f \colon 1, 2 \mapsto \ast \,.
\]

For the second part of this exercise we can similarly consider the non-surjective function
\[
	g
	\colon
	\{ \ast \} \to \{ 1, 2 \} \,,
	\quad
	\ast \mapsto 1
\]
and the subcategory~$\cat{C}'$ of~$\Set$ whose objects are the two sets~$\{ \ast \}$ and~$\{ 1, 2 \}$ and whose morphisms are~$\id_{\{ \ast \}}$,~$\id_{\{ 1, 2 \}}$ and~$g$.
