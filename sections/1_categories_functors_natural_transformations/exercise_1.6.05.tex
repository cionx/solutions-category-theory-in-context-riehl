\subsection{}

We can adapt our argumentation from the previous exercise.



\subsubsection*{A non-injective monomorphism}

We can consider the non-injective map
\[
	f \colon \{ 1, 2 \} \to \ast \,,
\]
and the subcategory of~$\Set$ whose objects are the two sets~$\{ \ast \}$ and~$\{ 1, 2 \}$ and whose morphisms are~$\id_{\{ \ast \}}$,~$\id_{\{ 1, 2 \}}$ and~$f$.



\subsubsection*{A non-surjective epimorphism}

We can similarly consider the non-surjective function
\[
	g
	\colon
	\{ \ast \} \to \{ 1, 2 \} \,,
	\quad
	\ast \mapsto 1 \,,
\]
and the subcategory of~$\Set$ whose objects are the two sets~$\{ \ast \}$ and~$\{ 1, 2 \}$ and whose morphisms are~$\id_{\{ \ast \}}$,~$\id_{\{ 1, 2 \}}$ and~$g$.
