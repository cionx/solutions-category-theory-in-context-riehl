\subsection{}

Let~$G$ and~$H$ be two groups.
A functor~$Φ$ from~$\Base G$ to~$\Base H$ consists of a set-theoretic function $\{ \ast \} \to \{ \ast \}$ together with a set-theoretic function
\[
	φ \colon G \to H
\]
such that
\[
	φ(\id_\ast) = \id_\ast
	\quad\text{and}\quad
	φ(g_1 g_2) = φ(g_1) φ(g_2)
\]
for all~$g_1, g_2 ∈ G$.
The second condition means precisely that~$φ$ is a homomorphism of groups, and this then entails the first condition.

We see that a functor from~$\Base G$ to~$\Base H$ is \enquote{the same} as a homomorphism of groups from~$G$ to~$H$.
