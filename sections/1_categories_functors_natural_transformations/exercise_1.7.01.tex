\subsection{}

Let~$\cat{C}$ be a small category and let~$\cat{D}$ be a locally small category.
Let~$F$ and~$G$ be two objects of the functor category~$\cat{D}^{\cat{C}}$, i.e., two functors from~$\cat{C}$ to~$\cat{D}$.
Let~$\Nat(F, G)$ be the collection of natural transformations from~$F$ to~$G$.
The map
\[
	\Nat(F, G) \to ∏_{c ∈ \cat{C}} \cat{D}(F c, G c) \,,
	\quad
	α \mapsto (α_c)_c
\]
is injective, and its codomain is a small product of sets, and therefore again a set.
It follows that the collection~$\Nat(F, G)$ is also a set.
