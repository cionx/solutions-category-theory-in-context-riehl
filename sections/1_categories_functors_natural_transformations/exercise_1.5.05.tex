\subsection{}

Let~$P$ be the partially ordered set consisting of the two natural numbers~$0$ and~$1$ with the usual ordering~$0 < 1$.
Let~$Q$ be the preordered set consisting of two distinct elements~$x$ and~$y$ with both~$x ≤ y$ and~$y ≤ x$.
Let~$\cat{P}$ and~$\cat{Q}$ be the categories corresponding to~$P$ and~$Q$ respectively.

The map
\[
	P \to Q \,,
	\quad
	0 \mapsto x \,,
	\quad
	1 \mapsto y
\]
is isotone, and therefore describes a functor~$F \colon \cat{P} \to \cat{Q}$.
The functor~$F$ is faithful because functors from a (category corresponding to a) preordered set into any other category are always faithful.

The unique arrow~$0 \to 1$ in~$\cat{P}$ is not an isomorphism.
But its image under~$F$, which is the unique arrow~$x \to y$ in~$\cat{Q}$, is an isomorphism.
The functor~$F$ therefore doesn’t reflect isomorphisms.
