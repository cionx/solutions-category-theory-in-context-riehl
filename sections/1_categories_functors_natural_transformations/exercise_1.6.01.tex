Let~$\cat{C}$ be a category, let~$i$ be an initial object in~$\cat{C}$, let~$t$ be a terminal object in~$\cat{C}$, and let~$f$ be a morphism from~$t$ to~$i$.

There exists a unique morphism~$g$ from~$i$ to~$t$ because~$i$ is initial in~$\cat{C}$ (and also because~$t$ is terminal in~$\cat{C}$).
The composite~$f g$ is a morphism from~$i$ to~$i$, and there exists only one such morphism in~$\cat{C}$ because~$i$ is initial in~$\cat{C}$.
The identity morphism~$\id_i$ is also a morphism from~$i$ to~$i$, so by this uniqueness, we must have~$f g = \id_i$.
By using that~$t$ is terminal in~$\cat{C}$, we can similarly see that~$g f = \id_t$.

This shows that~$f$ is an isomorphism with inverse~$g$.
