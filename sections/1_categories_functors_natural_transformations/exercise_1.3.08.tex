\subsection{}

Let~$𝟙$ be the category consisting of a single object~$\ast$ and only the respective identity morphism.
Let~$𝟚$ be the category consisting of two objects, named~$0$ and~$1$, and a single non-identity morphism, namely~$f \colon 0 \to 1$.
The unique functor from~$𝟚$ to~$𝟙$ maps~$f$ onto the identity morphism of~$\ast$, which is an isomorphism.
But~$f$ is not an isomorphism in~$𝟚$ because there exists no morphism from~$1$ to~$0$ in~$𝟚$.
