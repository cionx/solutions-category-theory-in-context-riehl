Let~$A$ be a subset of a poset~$(\cat{P}, ≤)$.



\subsubsection*{Definition of the supremum}

An element~$s$ of~$\cat{P}$ is a supremum of~$A$ if and only if for every element~$x$ of~$\cat{P}$ the following condition holds:~%
$x ≥ s$ if and only if~$x ≥ a$ for every~$a ∈ A$.
In categorical terms, this condition means that for every object~$x$ of~$\cat{P}$, there exists a morphism~$s \to x$ if and only if there exists a morphism~$a \to x$ for every object~$a$ contained in~$A$.



\subsubsection*{Definition of the infimum}

Dually, an object~$i$ of~$\cat{P}$ is an infimum of~$A$ if and only if for every object~$x$ of~$\cat{P}$, there exists a morphism~$x \to i$ if and only if there exists a morphism~$x \to a$ for every object~$a$ of~$A$.
That is,~$i$ is an infimum of~$A$ in~$\cat{P}$ if and only if it is a supremum of~$A$ in~$\cat{P}^{\op}$.



\subsubsection*{Uniqueness of the supremum}

Let now~$s_1$ and~$s_2$ be two suprema of~$A$.
There exists a morphism~$s_1 \to s_1$, namely the identity morphism.
As~$s_1$ is a supremum of~$A$, there hence exists for every object~$a$ contained in~$A$ a morphism~$a \to s_1$.
As~$s_2$ is a supremum of~$A$, it follows that there exists a morphism~$f \colon s_1 \to s_2$.
By switching the roles of~$s_1$ and~$s_2$ we also find that there exists a morphism~$g \colon s_2 \to s_1$.

The composite~$f g$ is a morphism~$s_2 \to s_2$, and has therefore the same domain and codomain as the identity morphism~$\id_{s_2}$.
For any two objects~$x$ and~$y$ in~$\cat{P}$ there exists at most one morphism from~$x$ to~$y$, whence it follows that~$f g = \id_{s_2}$.
We find in the same way that also~$g f = \id_{s_1}$.

This shows that~$f$ is an isomorphism with inverse~$g$.
But any two isomorphic objects of~$\cat{P}$ are already equal (because the relation~$≤$ on~$\cat{P}$ is antisymmetric).
We hence find that~$s_1 = s_2$.



\subsubsection*{Uniqueness of the infimum}

Suppose that~$i_1$ and~$i_2$ are two infima of~$A$.
This means that~$i_1$ and~$i_2$ are suprema of~$A$ in~$\cat{P}^{\op}$, whence~$i_1 = i_2$.
