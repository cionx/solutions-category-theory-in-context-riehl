\label{if left and right invertible then isomorphism}

We find that
\[
	g = g \id_x = g f h = \id_y h = h \,.
\]
It follows from this equality~$g = h$ that $g$ is not only a left-sided inverse to $f$, but also a right-sided inverse.
Therefore,~$g$ is a two-sided inverse to~$f$.
The existence of this two-sided inverse means that~$f$ is an isomorphism.

We have already proven this in our solution to the previous part of this exercise.
