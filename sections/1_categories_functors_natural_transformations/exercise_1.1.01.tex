\label{if left and right invertible then isomorphism}

We find that
\[
	g = g \id_x = g f h = \id_y h = h \,.
\]
It follows from this equality~$g = h$ that the morphism~$g$ is not only a left-sided inverse to the morphism~$f$, but also a right-sided inverse, because~$h$ is a right-sided inverse to~$f$.
Therefore,~$g$ is a two-sided inverse to~$f$.
The existence of this two-sided inverse means precisely that~$f$ is an isomorphism.



\subsubsection{}

Suppose that a morphism~$f \colon x \to y$ in a category~$\cat{C}$ admits two inverses~$g$ and~$h$.
This means, more explicitly, that both~$g$ and~$h$ are two-sided inverse to~$f$.
This entails that~$g f = \id_x$ and also~$f h = \id_y$.
According to the previous part of this exercise, we thus have~$g = h$.
