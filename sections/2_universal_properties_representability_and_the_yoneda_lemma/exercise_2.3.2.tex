We observe that for every bilinear map~$β \colon 𝕜 × V \to W$ we have the equality
\[
	β(λ, v) = β(1, λ v) \,.
\]
for all~$λ ∈ 𝕜$,~$v ∈ V$.
This implies that~$β$ is uniquely determined by the linear map
\[
	V \to W \,,
	\quad
	v \mapsto β(1, v) \,.
\]

Suppose conversely that we are given an arbitrary linear map~$g \colon V \to W$.
The map
\[
	𝕜 × V \to W \,,
	\quad
	(λ, v) \mapsto λ g(v)
\]
is then bilinear.

The above two constructions are mutually inverse, and give an isomorphism of vector spaces
\[
	\Bil(𝕜, V; W)
	≅
	\Vect_𝕜(V, W)
\]
that is natural in both~$V$ and~$W$.
It follows that we have the sequence of isomorphisms
\[
	\Vect_𝕜(𝕜 ⊗_𝕜 V, W)
	≅
	\Bil(𝕜, V; W)
	≅
	\Vect_𝕜(V, W)
\]
that is natural in both~$V$ and~$W$.
The isomorphism of functors
\[
	\Vect_𝕜(k ⊗_𝕜 V, \ph)
	≅
	\Vect_𝕜(V, \ph)
\]
tells us that~$k ⊗_𝕜 V ≅ V$.

We have the sequence isomorphisms
\begin{align*}
	\Vect_𝕜(U ⊗_𝕜 (V ⊗_𝕜 W), X)
	&≅
	\Bil(U, V ⊗_𝕜 W; X) \\
	&≅
	\Vect_𝕜(U, \Vect_𝕜(V ⊗_𝕜 W, X)) \\
	&≅
	\Vect_𝕜(U, \Bil(V, W; X)) \\
	&≅
	\Vect_𝕜(U, \Vect_𝕜(V, \Vect_𝕜(W, X))) \\
	&≅
	\Tril(U, V, W; X)
\end{align*}
and similarly
\begin{align*}
	\Vect_𝕜((U ⊗_𝕜 V) ⊗_𝕜 W, X)
	&≅
	\Bil(U ⊗_𝕜 V, W; X) \\
	&≅
	\Vect_𝕜(U ⊗_𝕜 V, \Vect_𝕜(W, X)) \\
	&≅
	\Bil(U, V; \Vect_𝕜(W, X)) \\
	&≅
	\Vect_𝕜(U, \Vect_𝕜(V, \Vect_𝕜(W, X))) \\
	&≅
	\Tril(U, V, W; X) \,.
\end{align*}
All these isomorphisms are natural in~$U$,~$V$,~$W$ and~$X$.
The isomorphism of functors
\begin{align*}
	\Vect_𝕜(U ⊗_𝕜 (V ⊗_𝕜 W), \ph)
	&≅
	\Tril(U, V, W; \ph) \\
	&≅
	\Vect_𝕜((U ⊗_𝕜 V) ⊗_𝕜 W, \ph)
\end{align*}
tells us that~$U ⊗_𝕜 (V ⊗_𝕜 W) ≅ (U ⊗_𝕜 V) ⊗_𝕜 W$.
