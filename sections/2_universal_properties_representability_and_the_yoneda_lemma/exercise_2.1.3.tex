\subsection{}

We first observe that parts~(i) and~(ii) are equivalent:

Let~$K$ be an essential inverse to~$H$.
We have the sequence of isomorphisms
\[
	  F K
	≅ G H K
	≅ G \Id_{\cat{D}}
	≅ G \,.
\]
We hence find that parts~(i) and~(ii) are interchangeable via
\[
	\cat{C} \onetoone \cat{D} \,,
	\quad
	F \onetoone G \,,
	\quad
	H \onetoone K \,.
\]
In the following, we prove part~(i).

That~$G$ is representable tells us that there exists an object~$d$ of~$\cat{D}$ such that~$G ≅ \cat{D}(d, \ph)$.
There exists an object~$c$ of~$\cat{C}$ with~$d ≅ H(c)$ because the functor~$H$ is an equivalence, and thus essentially surjective.
It follows that
\[
	  F
	≅ G H
	≅ \cat{D}(d, \ph) H
	≅ \cat{D}(d, H(\ph))
	≅ \cat{D}(H(c), H(\ph))
	≅ \cat{C}(c, \ph) \,.
\]
This shows that the functor~$F$ is represented by the object~$c$.
