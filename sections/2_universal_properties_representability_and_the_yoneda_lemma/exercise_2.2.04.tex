\subsection{}

We know that a natural transformation is a natural isomorphism if and only if it is an isomorphism in each component.
The isomorphisms in~$\Set$ are precisely the bijective maps.
A natural transformation between~\valued{$\Set$} functors is therefore a natural isomorphism if and only if it is bijective in each component.

We also know that the induced transformations~$f_*$ and~$f^*$ in parts~(ii) and~(iii) are always natural.

This exercise is therefore just a reformulation of Lemma~1.2.3.
