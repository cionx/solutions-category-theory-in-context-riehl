\subsection{}

A subfunctor~$F$ of~$\cat{C}(c, \ph)$ consists of a subset~$F(x)$ of~$\cat{C}(c, x)$ for every~$x ∈ \cat{C}$ such that
\[
	g_*( F(x) ) ⊆ F(y)
\]
for every morphism~$g \colon x \to y$ in~$\cat{C}$.
In other words, we have a collection of distinguished morphisms that is closed under post-composition with arbitrary other morphisms.

We have not been able to find a better, or more explicit description of such subfunctors.
