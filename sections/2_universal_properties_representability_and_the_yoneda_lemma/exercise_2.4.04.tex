\subsection{}

Let~$Ω$ be the Sierpiński space, consisting of the two elements~$⊤$ and~$⊥$ and three open subsets~$∅$,~$\{ ⊤ \}$ and~$Ω$.

Let~$\Open$ be the contravariant functor from~$\Top$ to~$\Set$ that assigns to each topological space its set of open subsets.
We find that
\begin{align*}
	{}&
	\left\{
	\begin{tabular}{l@{}}
		there exists for every topological space~$X$ \\
		and every open subset~$U$ of~$X$ \\
		a unique continuous map~$χ$ from~$X$ to~$Ω$ with~$U = χ^{-1}(\{ ⊤ \})$
	\end{tabular}
	\right.
	\\[0.3em]
	\iff{}&
	\left\{
	\begin{tabular}{l@{}}
		there exists for every object~$X$ of~$\Top$ and every element~$U$ of~$\Open(X)$ \\
		a unique morphism~$χ \colon X \to Ω$ in~$\Top$ with~$U = \Open(χ)(\{ ⊤ \})$
	\end{tabular}
	\right.
\end{align*}
We know that the first condition holds true, so the second condition also holds true.
But the second condition tells us that the element~$\{ ⊤ \}$ of~$\Open(Ω)$ is a universal element for the functor~$F$.
In this sense, the open subset~$\{ ⊤ \}$ of~$Ω$ is the universal open subset.
In a weaker sense, this means that~$Ω$ is the universal topological space with an open subset.
