\subsection{}

We abbreviate the sets~$\mor C$ and~$\ob C$ as~$M$ and~$O$ respectively.
We have thus two sets~$M$ and~$O$ and the functions
\[
	\dom, \codom \colon M \to O \,,
	\quad
	\idfun \colon O \to M \,.
\]
The domain of the composition function is the set
\[
	\{
		(f, g) ∈ M × M
		\suchthat
		\codom f = \dom g
	\} \,,
\]
which can be described as the pullback of the following diagram:
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		{}
		&
		M
		\arrow{d}[right]{\codom}
		\\
		M
		\arrow{r}[below]{\dom}
		&
		O
	\end{tikzcd}
\]
We thus denote this domain by~$M ×_O M$, so that
\[
	\comp
	\colon
	M ×_O M \to M \,,
	\quad
	(f, g) \mapsto gf
\]
is the composition function.

We need to express in terms of diagrams the associativity of~$\comp$ and that identities act as neutral elements with respect to decomposition.
\begin{itemize}

	\item
		To express the associativity of composition we need to introduce the triple-pull\-back
		\[
			M ×_O M ×_O M
			≔
			\left\{
				(f, g, h) ∈ M × M × M
				\suchthat*
				\begin{array}{l}
					\codom f = \dom g \,, \\
					\codom g = \dom h
				\end{array}
			\right\} \,.
		\]
		The associativity of~$\comp$ can be expressed by the commutativity of the following diagram:
		\[
			\begin{tikzcd}
				M ×_O M ×_O M
				\arrow{d}[left]{{\comp} × {\id}}
				\arrow{r}[above]{{\id} × {\comp}}
				&
				M ×_O M
				\arrow{d}[right]{\comp}
				\\
				M ×_O M
				\arrow{r}[below]{\comp}
				&
				M
			\end{tikzcd}
		\]

	\item
		We need for every object~$x$ that~$x$ is both the domain and the codomain of~$\id_x$:
		This means that the following two diagrams have to commute:
		\[
			\begin{tikzcd}
				O
				\arrow{r}[above]{\idfun}
				\arrow{dr}[below left]{\id}
				&
				M
				\arrow{d}[right]{\dom}
				\\
				{}
				&
				O
			\end{tikzcd}
			\qquad
			\begin{tikzcd}
				O
				\arrow{r}[above]{\idfun}
				\arrow{dr}[below left]{\id}
				&
				M
				\arrow{d}[right]{\codom}
				\\
				{}
				&
				O
			\end{tikzcd}
		\]
		This then ensures that we have well-defined maps
		\[
			α_1
			\colon
			M \to M ×_O M \,,
			\quad
			f \mapsto (\id_{\dom f}, f)
		\]
		and
		\[
			α_2
			\colon
			M \to M ×_O M \,,
			\quad
			f \mapsto (f, \id_{\codom f}) \,.
		\]
		We need for the following two diagrams to commute:
		\[
			\begin{tikzcd}
				M
				\arrow{r}[above]{α_1}
				\arrow{dr}[below left]{\id}
				&
				M ×_O M
				\arrow{d}[right]{\comp}
				\\
				{}
				&
				M
			\end{tikzcd}
			\qquad
			\begin{tikzcd}
				M
				\arrow{r}[above]{α_2}
				\arrow{dr}[below left]{\id}
				&
				M ×_O M
				\arrow{d}[right]{\comp}
				\\
				{}
				&
				M
			\end{tikzcd}
		\]

\end{itemize}
