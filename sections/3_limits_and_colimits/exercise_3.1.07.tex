\subsection{}

Let~$l, m \colon Q \to P$ be two morphisms in the ambient category~$\cat{C}$ with~$k l = k m$.
We then also have
\[
	f h l = g k l = g k m = f h m
\]
by the commutativity of the pullback square, and thus~$h l = h m$ because~$f$ is a monomorphism.
It follows from the two equalities
\[
	k l = k m \,,
	\quad
	h l = h m
\]
and the universal property of the pullback~$(P, h, k)$ that already~$l = m$.
