\subsection{}

We simply rewrite the first proof in a more elaborate way.

The universal property of a limit cone~$(ℓ, λ)$ over~$F$ asserts that for every other cone~$(d, μ)$ over~$F$, there exists a unique morphism of cones~$f$ from~$(d, μ)$ to~$(ℓ, λ)$.
The  cone~$(ℓ', λ')$ satisfies the same universal property:
there exists for every cone~$(d, μ)$ on~$F$ a unique morphism of cones~$f'$ from~$(d, μ)$ to~$(ℓ', λ')$.

It follows is particular that there exists a unique morphism of cones~$f$ from~$(ℓ, λ)$ to~$(ℓ', λ')$, as well as a unique morphism of cones~$f'$ from~$(ℓ', λ')$ to~$(ℓ, λ)$.
The composite~$f' f$ is a morphism of cones from~$(ℓ, λ)$ to itself.
But by the universal property of~$(ℓ, λ)$, there exists precisely one such morphism, and~$\id_{(ℓ, λ)}$ is also such a morphism.
Consequently,
\[
	f' f = \id_{(ℓ, λ)} \,.
\]
We find in the same way that also~$f f' = \id_{(ℓ', λ')}$.

We have seen that there exists a unique morphism of cones from~$(ℓ, λ)$ to~$(ℓ', λ')$, and that this morphism is an isomorphism.
This entails that~$ℓ$ and~$ℓ'$ are isomorphic as objects in~$\cat{C}$, and that there exists precisely one such isomorphism compatible with the cones~$λ$ and~$λ'$.
