\subsection{}

We can describe~$\Sq(f, g)$ more explicitly as
\[
	\Sq(f, g)
	=
	\{
		(h, k)
		\suchthat
		h \colon a \textto c, \,
		k \colon b \textto d, \,
		g h = k f
	\} \,.
\]
In other words,~$\Sq(f, g)$ is the pullback of the following diagram:
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		{}
		&
		\cat{C}(a, c)
		\arrow{d}[right]{g_*}
		\\
		\cat{C}(b, d)
		\arrow{r}[below]{f^*}
		&
		\cat{C}(a, d)
	\end{tikzcd}
\]
