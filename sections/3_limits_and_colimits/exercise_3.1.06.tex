\subsection{}

The universal property of the equalizer tells us for every object~$X$ of the ambient category~$\cat{C}$ that the map
\[
	h_*
	\colon
	\cat{C}(X, E) \to \cat{C}(X, A) \,,
	\quad
	k \mapsto h k
\]
restricts to a bijection
\[
	\cat{C}(X, E)
	\to
	\{ l \in \cat{C}(X, A) \suchthat f l = g l \} \,.
\]
This entails that the map~$h_*$ is injective.
That this injectivity holds for every object~$X$ of~$\cat{C}$ means precisely that the morphism~$h$ is a monomorphism.
