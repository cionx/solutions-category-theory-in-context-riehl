\subsection{}

Pullbacks are only well-defined up to isomorphism.
In the given situation, the two cones~$(ℤ, a, b)$ and~$(ℤ, -a, -b)$ are isomorphic via the isomorphism of cones
\[
	ℤ \to ℤ \,,
	\quad
	x \mapsto -x \,.
\]
Thus,~$(ℤ, a, b)$ is a pullback for the given diagram if and only if~$(ℤ, -a, -b)$ is one.
